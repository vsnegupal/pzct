TO-DO LIST

Should start doing:
- make a function that toggles the value of a parameter "SafehouseAllowLoot" in servertest.ini on reboot

In the near future:
- need to make an init function that will determine whether the system has the necessary utilities,
    such as pv and pbzip2 (maybe something else), and if not, it will point to their installation
    and perform some other checks.
- create a config file to store variables in, figure out how to fill it in.

After that:
- implement a line-by-line check of the server-console.txt file
    to detect messages that a player cannot log in because of an unupdated mod on the server.
    If there are no messages - save the line number and next time start from it,
    otherwise restart the server.
